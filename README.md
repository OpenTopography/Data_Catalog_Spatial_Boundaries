# OpenTopography Data Catalog Spatial Boundaries
Spatial boundaries of topography datasets available via OpenTopography. Individual dataset boundaries in GeoJSON and combined data collections in TopoJSON formats.

GeoJSON and TopoJSON are formats for encoding geographic data structures. GeoJSON stores geographic data in a format similar to JSON, while TopoJSON is an extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology, allowing for more compact files and efficient rendering by eliminating redundancy in shared borders between features. Both formats can be used with various GIS software and web mapping libraries.
