US Interagency Elevation Inventory

The U.S. Interagency Elevation Inventory shows availability of high-accuracy topographic and bathymetric data for the United States and its territories. The project is a collaborative effort between NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey, with contributions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This resource is a comprehensive, nationwide listing of known high-accuracy topographic data, including lidar and IfSAR, and bathymetric data, including NOAA hydrographic surveys, multibeam data, and bathymetric lidar. OpenTopography federates access to the USIEI as a service to our users. Visit United States Interagency Elevation Inventory to learn more about the USIEI
